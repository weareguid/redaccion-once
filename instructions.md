# Editorial Voice Fine-tuning Project

## Overview
This project aims to fine-tune a language model to replicate the editorial voice of articles across various domains (economics, finance, tourism, etc.). The model will be trained on a corpus of 50 articles per format, with plans to expand the dataset. The project will be implemented in phases, starting with a local pilot and later moving to cloud deployment.

### Business Goals
- Create a model that accurately reproduces the editorial voice across different article types
- Enable both real-time and batch processing of articles
- Support human-in-the-loop feedback for continuous improvement
- Handle approximately 50 articles per day in production

### Guardrails
- Maintain consistent voice across different domains
- Ensure proper handling of different article formats
- Implement robust error handling and validation
- Support human review and feedback mechanisms

## Dataset Preparation

### Data Collection
- Initial corpus: 50 articles per format
- Categories: economics, finance, tourism, etc.
- Format: Word documents
- Metadata: type, region, theme

### Preprocessing Pipeline
1. Document parsing
   - Convert Word to text using python-docx
   - Extract metadata with custom parsers
   - Clean formatting with regex patterns
   - Handle multiple languages and encodings
2. Text cleaning
   - Remove headers/footers with pattern matching
   - Standardize formatting with style templates
   - Handle special characters and Unicode
   - Implement domain-specific cleaning rules
3. Dataset splitting
   - 80% training
   - 10% validation
   - 10% test
   - Stratified sampling by article type
